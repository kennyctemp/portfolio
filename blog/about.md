Hi. I'm Kenny, and this is my blog. I worked in the music industry for ten years. Now, I'm (re)learning how to code and design software in hopes of making the digital music space better for everybody.

In this blog I will cover music, technology, business, and everything in between. I will try to update it as much as I am able.

Thanks for reading!
