Product Managers: what they do, and what it takes to be great.


One of the perks of being a MakerSquare student is the Lunch & Learn speaker series. The events are low-pressure opportunities for students to get some real-world questions answered, and to network with industry leaders. On the other side of the table, guests have the opportunity to see what newcomers in the field are working on and interested in. Oh, and everyone gets catered lunch. 

Last week, our guest was Matthias Wagner, a seasoned product manager. I was especially interested in his visit, because while most students come to MakerSquare to become great software engineers, eventually becoming a (great) product manager is something I am very interested in. 

Matthias shared with us a bit about what he does at work each day, and what traits and experiences usually make for a good product manager. Here’s what I learned: 

Matthias explained that a product manager (PM) has the job of looking at their product in a holistic way, and functions a lot like a miniature CEO. A product manager is the person responsible for a particular product (or product feature) for its entire life-cycle. 

Early in the product life-cycle, a PM can be responsible for leading customer surveys and research, identifying a user demographic, creating personas, and gathering and analyzing data that determines a direction for the product. 

Later in the product life-cycle, a PM creates a product roadmap, designs workflows for the engineering team, and ensures that everyone on the team stays focused on the goals--despite the ever-present temptation to add another feature.

Matthias also talked about what a good product manager brings to a team in terms of their personal qualities and experience. 

On the technical side of things, a product manager should be able to relate to the engineering team, and understand the possibilities and limitations of the technologies they’re working with. There’s a fine line, however, between relating to the engineers and telling the engineers how to do their jobs. Of course, doing the latter is a sure way to alienate your team. 

That brings me to Matthias’s next point: a good product manager is a great people person, and one of the social challenges of the job is keeping the whole team motivated. Matthias recommends giving each contributor a sense of ownership by not micromanaging their work. Again, PMs have to be savvy enough to give direction without prescribing technical solutions or otherwise telling people how to do their jobs. And finally, Matthias recommends motivating teams by regularly celebrating success.

There’s a cliche in the tech business that engineers and product managers are always at odds. I’ve learned there’s some truth in that, and it’s because their goals are often incompatible: PMs want to create the most functionality in a short amount of time, while engineers want to write sophisticated, clean, and maintainable code. At the end of the day, however, those competing goals are productive. Teams are stronger and build better products as a result.
