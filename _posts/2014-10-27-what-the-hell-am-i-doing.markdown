What the hell am I doing?

I’ve been chipping away at a career in the music industry for half my life. And, I did it. 

I graduated college from one of the best music schools in existence. I’ve toured with some of the biggest bands in the world. I’ve gotten to work directly with some of the biggest artists and industry executives on the planet. I started my own artist management firm in New York City where I was able to get artists signed to major and independent labels, publishers, agency deals, watch them make records, tour the world, and generally help them realize their wildest dreams. I had the chance to work for a label I had followed since high school, where I got to sign artists I believed in, set up all aspects of their campaign, and forge relationships with companies like Apple, Google, Spotify, Pandora, and more. 

Yet, I just quit my job. I am now sitting surrounded by my belongings packed into boxes in my Los Angeles home.

What the hell am I doing?

In one week, I will be driving almost 400 miles up to San Francisco, where I will remain unemployed for at least the next 4 months. What’s in San Francisco? I’m not 100% sure yet, but I know it’s what I’ve been missing so far in New York and Los Angeles. Even during the whole journey which I described above, I felt there was something missing in what I had to offer in my career. I always had this voice in the back of my head telling me that I was needed elsewhere. I knew that I wanted to be working with the digital service providers who we, as musicians and their teams, were depending on to ensure our future, but I didn’t study computer science in college. I felt it would be near impossible to shift to that side of the business, the part where I really believed I could make a difference for everyone that I studied and worked with.

What the hell am I doing?

During my time at the label, in an attempt to be more proactive with our digital marketing efforts, I decided to get reacquainted with an old friend, HTML. I had originally started making websites and programming in BASIC as a kid back in the 1990s. However, I had fallen out of it as I was getting into my high school years. Somehow, I must have decided that guitars and girls were cooler than programming computers. But, I digress. Earlier this year, a digital agency that the label worked with suggested that I check out Treehouse. I started diving back into HTML and CSS, and quickly realizing that after 20 years of web evolution, I may as well have been starting from scratch. Slowly, but surely, I started getting proficient at making landing pages. I decided that I wanted to be able to do a little more with those pages I was making, so I started learning Javascript. “Hello World.” That’s when the bug bit me. Everything that I had learned about programming as a kid started flooding back into my brain….loops, variables, conditionals, etc. All these core concepts were still the same. That was it, game over. I stopped going out on nights and weekends. I stayed in and started reading and learning everything I could about programming.

What the hell am I doing?

One thing I started to notice while scouring developer’s blogs, stack-overflow threads, and Quora posts was that a lot of developers were self-taught. Much like me, they didn’t study computer science in college. This only fueled my fire. I worked through all Javascript lessons that I could find on sites like Treehouse, Codecademy, Code School, and wherever else I could find. I started using MIT’s Open Courseware to make sure that I was learning fundamental computer science foundations. The path I needed to take in my career was becoming clearer every day, but I believed that I would ultimately need to take my learning to the next level. The problem with teaching yourself everything is that what you don’t know, is what you don’t know.

So, what the hell am I doing?

I have been accepted to a software engineering bootcamp program called Makersquare. I will spend the next 12 weeks covering software engineering fundamentals with a focus on developing web applications using Javascript, Ruby, and a whole mess of frameworks and libraries. It’s equally terrifying as it is exciting. Luckily, the bulk of the digital service providers who I would love to work for are all located in the bay area. My fingers are crossed that I will be able to bridge my previous experience in the “traditional” music business with my new found reconnection to my programming roots, and be able to achieve a product management role at a company who is doing exciting things. I also have several ideas of my own that I can’t wait to start working on.

I will do my best to keep updating this blog. Keep checking back if you’re interested in following along.
