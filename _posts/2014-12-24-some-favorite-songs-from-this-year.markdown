What a year. I was in NYC, Austin, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Chicago, and probably some others that I'm forgetting. Pretty much all of those were multiple instances too. I was able to release some records of awesome bands that I helped sign, watched them chart on Billboard and proceed to sell out lots of shows! Another rock 'n roll bucket list check mark.

There were lots of changes too. I quit my job at a rad record label to follow my gut on getting back into programming and web development after not having written a line of code in years. One side-effect I noticed in this process, however, was that it actually brought me closer to music than I'd felt in a long time. There is something to be said for fully immersing yourself in something, and loving what you do is important to keep you going everyday, but we must be careful to not let what we love define us. Nothing in life is ever perfect, so when you live and die by what you love, it can be easy to lose sight of why you loved it in the first place.

I remember finishing college at Berklee and feeling excited because music could finally be fun again. It didn't have to be "work" anymore, as it often felt while in school. And for that brief, guilt-free window of unemployment immediately following graduation, it was. Then, as I got deeper into the business of buying and selling something so near and dear to me, and having less and less time to practice or play music myself, it slowly got less fun again. 

Strangely enough, however, programming and web development has helped scratch that itch. I have found that music and modern software engineering draw from a lot of the same thought processes. Web software is very orchestral in nature. I am the composer and I am writing all of the parts for the different instruments. There is a database and back-end anchoring the program down like a rhythm section, and then there are the front-end UI pieces (JS libraries, HTML, CSS, etc) causing harmony and carrying the topline melody to the audience. Both software and music are creative, yet analytical and pragmatic mediums. They take a small set of principles and rules, and then use those to create anything, hence the title of my blog!

That being said, I wasn't surprised to find <a href="https://teamgaslight.com/blog/why-are-so-many-software-developers-also-musicians" target="blank">articles like this one</a>, citing just how many musicians are developers. According to this article, IBM used to recruit music majors to learn programming back in the early days of computing. Based on <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/andy-kessler-mothers-tell-your-children-to-be-software-coders-1411770575" target="blank">lots of other articles about the current state of supply/demand for tech workers</a>, maybe they should think about doing that again?

On that note, here are some of my favorte tunes from this year.
